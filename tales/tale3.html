    <h2>The Non-profit horror story</h2>
    <p>Like all Drupal sites, this Drupal site had many modules</p>
</section>



<section>
    <h2> The site got compromised, and a PHP shell script was uploaded</h2>
    <p class="fragment">All modules were up to date.</p>
    <p class="fragment"> There were no known vulnerabilities in any of the modules used, that would have allowed for a PHP shell to be uploaded. </p>
    <p class="fragment"> Jack Merridew, the head of their webteam was able to see the php script was used to copy down the users tables.  </p>

</section>
<section>
    <h2>hacked</h2>
    <p class="fragment"> It may have been able to download  more parts of the database, but the attacker only left a copy of the users table behind.  </p>
    <p class="fragment"> The PHP script that was uploaded allowed the attacker to have file system access (download any file including files from Drupal's private file system.  </p>
    <p class="fragment"> It also allowed the attacker to run and display the results of SQL queries.   </p>

    <h2> A module used a 3rd party library</h2>
    <p>The library was updated, however, unless you deleted the old version before installing the new version, you were still vulnerable</p>

    <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
    <p>Remove the library/module/theme before updating, this ensures that all old files are removed</p>
    <p>Configure PHP so it will not execute code from directories it should not (sites/*/files) </p>
    <p>Prevent the webserver from writing to directories that are not (sites/*/files) </p>
    <p> The security_review module can help with this.</p>
