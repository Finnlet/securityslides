    <h2>The Non-profit horror story</h2>
    <p>Like all Drupal sites, this Drupal site had many modules</p>
</section>


<section>
    <h2> The site got compromised, and a PHP shell script was uploaded</h2>
    <p>All modules were up to date.</p>
    <p> There were no known vulnerabilities in any of the modules used, that would have allowed for a PHP shell to be uploaded. </p>

    <h2>Module updates</h2>

    <h2> A module used a 3rd party library</h2>
    <p>The library was updated, however, unless you deleted the old version before installing the new version, you were still vulnerable</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2> .....</h2>
    <p> After the attacker uploaded a script they were able to harvest usernames and passwords</p>
    <p> As well as get access to the entire database</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
    <p>Remove the library/module/theme before updating, this ensures that all old files are removed</p>
    <p>Configure PHP so it will not execute code from directories it should not (sites/*/files) </p>
    <p>Prevent the webserver from writing to directories that are not (sites/*/files) </p>
