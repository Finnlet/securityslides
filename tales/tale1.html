    <h2>The tale of the shoe store</h2>

    <p> Our first tale is that of a where you can order products. This site takes orders and redirects you to a 3rd
        party for payment. This keeps the site PCI compliant. </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>The site was first brought online on November 15th, 2012 </p>

    <p> The site has around 300 order per month</p>

    <p> The company that built the site hired a devshop that did not provide support after the site went live</p>

    <p> The company did not have a full time web person on staff</p>

    <h2>On a cold dark Monday</h2>

    <p> The book keeper noticed that they were not getting money in their account.</p>

    <p> Their order volume did not change</p>

    <p> She called the credit card company who said that they had not gotten any orders in the last 2 weeks.</p>

    <p> She went online and placed an order,it seemed to work as it should.</p>

    <p> She was very confused</p>

    <p> The date was March 11th, 2013 </p>

    <p>The normal workflow is </p>

    <h2> How it should work</h2>

    <p>
        Customer goes to checkout -> is redirected to payment gateway on third party site -> pays -> gets redirected
        back to merchant site.
    </p>
</section>

    <h2>What happened</h2>

    <p> Somehow a the URL for the payment gateway was changed in the Ubercart configuration</p>

    <p> The company they hired started to look at server logs and found that there was a change to this URL, by someone
        at the company's IP address</p>

    <h2>What really happened</h2>

    <p> Someone had used a security vulnerability in Ubercart and added Javascript in a field</p>

    <p> Normally the javascript would be escaped, but since the site was not patched for SA-CONTRIB-2013-020 - Ubercart
        - Cross site scripting (XSS), the javascript executed</p>

    <h2>Lessons Learned </h2>

    <p> Always update your site when the security team releases an update. (https://www.drupal.org/security) </p>

    <p> If you are dealing with sensitive data (credit card numbers) make sure you have the staff to do so, otherwise
        think about outsourcing everything. </p>

    <p> If collecting monies, check more often then every 2 weeks</p>
