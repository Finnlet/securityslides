    <h2>The tale of Fitzgerald's shoe store</h2>

    <p> Our first tale is that of a where you can order products. This site takes orders and redirects you to a 3rd
        party for payment. This keeps the site PCI compliant. </p>

    <h2>On a cold dark Monday</h2>

    <p class='fragment'> Myrtle Wilson, book keeper noticed that they were not getting money in their account.</p>

    <p class='fragment'> Their order volume did not change</p>

    <p class='fragment'> She called the credit card company who said that they had not gotten any orders in the last 2 weeks.</p>

    <p class='fragment'> She went online and placed an order,it seemed to work as it should.</p>

    <h2>On a colder darker Tuesday, they got help</h2>

    <p>Fitzgerald's shoe store in a expert, Jordan Baker, who analyzed the site.  He found that their payment gateway URL, was not pointing to their payment gateway </p>

    <h2> How it should work</h2>

    <p>
        Customer goes to checkout -> is redirected to payment gateway on third party site -> pays -> gets redirected
        back to merchant site.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>What happened</h2>

    <p class='fragment'> Somehow the URL for the payment gateway was changed in the Ubercart configuration</p>

    <p class='fragment'> Jordan Baker started to look at server logs and found that there was a POST request on the page to change this URL by someone
        at the company's IP address</p>
    <p class='fragment'>
        Myrtle was fired as the IP was her computer's address.
    </p>

    <h2>What really happened</h2>
    <p class='fragment'> Jordan Baker started to dig more and found...</p>
    <p class='fragment'> Someone had used a security vulnerability in Ubercart and added Javascript in a field</p>
    <p class='fragment'> Normally the javascript would be escaped, but since the site was not patched for SA-CONTRIB-2013-020 - Ubercart
        - Cross site scripting (XSS), the javascript executed</p>

    <h2>Lessons Learned </h2>
    <p class='fragment'> Always update your site when the security team releases an update. (https://www.drupal.org/security) </p>
    <p class='fragment'> If you are dealing with sensitive data (credit card numbers) make sure you have the staff to do so, otherwise
        think about outsourcing everything. </p>
    <p class='fragment'> If collecting monies, check more often then every 2 weeks</p>
    <p class='fragment'>XSS can do a lot of damage.</p>
