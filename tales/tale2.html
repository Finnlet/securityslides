    <h2>The tale of the new site. </h2>
    <p> Harpers's LLC, a small development in Alabama, started work on a new website</p>
    <p> The site (at a brand new domain) was provisioned 48 hours before it was hacked. </p>
    <p> The site was in maintenance mode</p>

</section>
<section>
    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p> A new domain was ordered and a site setup on that domain name. </p>

    <p> The site had all up to date modules installed and an up to date core</p>

    <p> The site as going to be a brochure type site with only one admin account. Think a basic corporate site.</p>
    <p> This was setup on a new development server, dedicated to dev sites for Harpers's LLC</p>

    <p class="fragment">Jeremy, the  content manager, was going to setup content types and notice the site had porn all over the front page</p>

    <p class="fragment"> Jeremy was not happy</p>

    <h2>What?</h2>

    <p>Jeremy the in  house IT person,Jean, who started looking at logs to see how an up to date Drupal site got
        compromised. </p>

    <p>Jean pulled the access logs for the server and found only known trusted  IP's accessed the site. </p>

    <p> Jean had no idea how it happened so she restored a backup</p>

    <h2> 2 days later</h2>

    <h2>Jean searched the logs again</h2>

    <p> Found only the same trusted IP's</p>

    <p> Only computers inside of Harpers's LLC offices had accessed the site</p>

    <p> Jean Ran a virus scan on the computers that had accessed the site</p>

    <p> The scan was clean</p>

    <p> Jean had no idea what was going on....</p>

    <h2>Apache single user</h2>

    <p> By default apache on most OS's will run as a single user </p>

    <p> That user has access to READ all the files for all sites on the system</p>
    <p> In some cases that user has access to write to all files on the system. (This is bad) </p>

</section>
<section>
    <h2>What happened</h2>
    <p> Someone had compromised another site on the server.</p>
    <p> Using that site, they were able to read settings.php and connect to the new Drupal site's database</p>
    <p> They were able to inject spam by updating the table directly</p>
    <p>The script used search the entire file system for settings.php and then ran commands to update the database on any site it found. </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Lessons Learned </h2>
    <p> Do not allow a single apache instance to access multiple sites. Configure privilege separation. </p>
    <p> Apache config is outside the scope of this presentation, but look into suphp, php-fpm and mod-itk </p>
    <p> Be-careful of using shared hosting without proper configuration</p>
    <p> Don't bring a site back online after a compromise unless you understand how and prevented future compromises</p>
